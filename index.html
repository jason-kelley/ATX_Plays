                            <h4>Player Restrictions</h4>
                            <p>Minimum Number of Players per Team Sixes The maximum number of players on the court is four. The minimum number of players is four. The minimum number of females is one.</p>
                            <h4>League Start Times &amp; Warmup</h4>
                            <p>All matches will start 15 minutes after time noted on schedule. For example, if you team has a 7 o'clock game, then your game will start at 7:15 If a team does not have the minimum number players (see above) at 15 minutes after,
                              they will forfeit the first game, 20 minutes and the match will be forfeited. Warmup will occur in the first 15 of your stated game time. If your team arrives 9 minutes after your scheduled start time, your team will have 6 minutes
                              of warmup.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Equipment</h4>
                            <p>Professional Sand Beach Volleyballs will be provided. No other ball is allowed for league play unless an alternate game ball has been agreed to by both teams. Court lines will be provided.</p>
                            <h4>Sportsmanship</h4>
                            <p>We are all adults, and ATX Plays expects all participants to act like it. Unsportsmanlike behavior may result in that player being ejected from the game. An ejection may result in further suspension from participation in current
                              and/or future ATX Plays sports and events. Ejected players are required to leave the playing area immediately. Refusal to leave the playing area may result in a team forfeit and/or further suspension.</p>
                              <h4>Game Structure</h4>
                              <p class="text-primary">Prior to starting, each team will engage in ATX Plays “2 minutes of awareness.” This time will be used for each team to talk to one another about the charity they are playing for. This is a great opportunity to raise awareness for
                                your cause. Occasionally, ATX Plays will use this time to allow invited charities to make their own presentation.</p>
                                <p>FORMAT:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Matches are best of three.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>Teams will switch serve and side after the first set.</li>
                                  <li>Prior to the first set, both captains will meet with the official to discuss ground rules and decide serve and side with a game of rock, paper, scissors. The winning captain will choose serve or side to begin the first set and,
                                    if needed, the deciding third set. The other captain will have the remaining option.</li>
                                    <li>A set, with the exception of the deciding third set, is won by the team which first scores 21 points with a minimum lead of two points or the team which first scores 25 points.</li>
                                    <li>In the case of a 1-1 tie, the deciding third set is
                                      won by the team which first scores 15 points with a minimum lead of two points or the team which first scores 17 points.</li>
                                      <li>Rally scoring rules shall apply to all sets. A point is scored by successfully grounding the ball on the opponent’s
                                        court, when the opponent commits a fault, or when the opponent receives a penalty.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p>TIME OUTS: Each team is entitled to a single one-minute time-out per set. Time-outs do not carry over.</p>
                                      <p>TEAM HITS:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>The team is entitled to a maximum of three hits (in addition to blocking) for returning the ball.</li>
                                        <li>A player may not hit the ball two times consecutively.</li>
                                        <li>The ball may touch any part of the body.</li>
                                        <li>The ball must be hit, not caught and/or
                                          thrown.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>BLOCKING: A block does not count as a hit. The first hit after the block may be executed by any player, including one who touched the ball during the block.</p>

                                          <li>A blocker may touch the ball beyond the net, provided that this does not interfere with the play before or during the opponent’s attack hit.</li>
                                          <li>Contact with the net is permitted provided it does not interfere with the play.</li>
                                          <li> Contact with the opponent’s court with a foot is permitted, provided it is not excessive or does not interfere with the play.</li>
                                          <li>When the ball is driven into the net and causes it to touch an opponent, no fault is committed.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                          <li>If the serving team wins a rally, it scores a point and continues to serve.</li>
                                          <li>If the receiving team wins a rally, it scores a point and gains the right to serve.</li>
                                          <li>Blocking the opponent’s service is not
                                            permitted.</li>
                                            <li>At the moment of service, the server may not step on or across the endline. A reasonable allowance may be given, at the official’s discretion, on courts with tight spaces.</li>
                                          </ul>

                                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                                    <p>ATX Plays LLC is Austin's first charity driven sports and social club for adults that want to raise awareness for local nonprofits. ATX Plays provides co-ed sports leagues, social events, and tournaments. Nonprofits speak at each event to help raise
                                      awareness for their cause and inform players about how they can help. In addition, a portion of all proceeds go towards local causes.</p>
                                      <h2>How ATX Plays Started</h2>
                                      <p>Owner, Shane R. Saum started ATX Plays in early 2016 to help local nonprofits reach more young professionals in Austin. Shane moved to Austin in 2014 from Cleveland, Ohio to start a career in public service while writing his dissertation for a PhD
                                        at Ohio University. He quickly became very involved in the community while working in the Texas capitol for a State Representative and then the Office of the Governor. Shane volunteers with multiple nonprofits around Austin including as a CASA
                                        volunteer, a board member at the YMCA Townlake, a Government Affairs Committee member for the Arc of Texas and an appointed Commissioner on the City of Austin Resources Management Commission. He also does pro bono legislative consulting for nonprofits
                                        and chaired the Austin Young Chamber Nonprofit Fair.</p>
